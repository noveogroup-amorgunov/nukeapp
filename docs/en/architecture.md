# Architecture

The project is developed by Feature Sliced Design (FSD) methodology. It combines the best architecture patterns (like domain driven design, vertical slice architecture, public API, layout isolation and so on). You can read more in the official documentation on https://feature-sliced.design/ .

## Solved common problems

The project has a lot of example how we can solve different cases with methodology which you will definitely meet on your way.

### Authorization

Core team recommends move all logic with updating access tokens and authorization in `shared/api` and store access token in `entity/session`. It solves two problems: cross imports and code duplication.

But I use advanced approach and move authorization/invalidating tokens in `features/authorization`. When token is expired, we emit special action [apiAccessTokenIsBrokenEvent](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/blob/main/src/shared/api/baseQueryWithReauth.ts#L36) from shared api, which listen in other layers.

See [entities/session/\*](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/tree/main/src/entities/session), [features/authorization/\*](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/tree/main/src/features/authentication) and [shared/api/\*](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/tree/main/src/shared/api) in code.

### Page Layout

Split layout to dumb component (with markup) and smart component for widget compositions. Dumb layout can be placed in `share/ui/Layout`, smart - `app/layouts/baseLayout.tsx`.

See [app/layouts/baseLayout.tsx](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/blob/main/src/app/layouts/baseLayout.tsx) and [shared/ui/Layout/\*](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/tree/main/src/shared/ui/Layout) in code.

### Using features into entity

Use render prop pattern (render slot) and pass features via props.

See example [widgets/BaseProductList/BaseProductList.tsx](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/blob/main/src/widgets/BaseProductList/ui/BaseProductList.tsx) in code. `entity/ProductCard` has `feature/AddToWishlist` and get it in props from `widget/BaseProductList`. So we don't violate FSD and can use features into entity.

### Relations between entities

See below ¬´[Entities cross imports](#Entities-cross-imports)¬ª.

### ESLint rules

Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@feature-sliced/eslint-config

## Limitation

FSD is a great solution, but every great solution tries to find harmony between correctness and productivity (for example, [see TypeScript non goals](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals)). FSD is strict and some cases in real project can't be solved without workarounds.

### Entities cross imports

In real ~~world~~ application, entities (our domain) has a lot of relations and can't use in isolation from each other. So we can't write a good domain layer without relationships. But FSD tell us that we can't use cross imports for same layer. For example, every product has a certain category:

```ts
// üìÅ entities/product/model/types.ts

// üëá FSD disallow this import
import type { CategoryId } from 'entities/category'

type Product = {
  id: ProductId
  category: CategoryId
}
```

What can we do? We can use advanced pattern "meta-categories" (only [in RFC](https://github.com/feature-sliced/documentation/discussions/390#discussioncomment-5570073)), which allow us to create special public API for related entity.

```ts
// üìÅ entities/category/@x/product

// üëá It's a Public API for `product` entity
export type { CategoryId } from '../model/types'
```

```ts
// üìÅ entities/product/model/types.ts

// üëá Import `CategoryId` from special public API for product
import type { CategoryId } from 'entities/category/@x/product'

type Product = {
  id: ProductId
  category: CategoryId
}
```

If we need to use `CategoryId` in other entity, we create `@x/{entity}` and export required dependencies as well. Advantages over plain cross imports are described in RFC, but the main of them:

- Writing such index files is a little bulky, which discourages cross-imports and encourages the search for alternative solutions that do not require cross-imports
- The list of types and objects that are shared between slices is explicit and predictable
- It reads nice in the import string like ¬´import something from (entity product)-x-category¬ª

You can see an example in this project in [entities/product/@x/\*](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/tree/main/src/entities/product/%40x)

Additionally, there is a fixing rule "boundaries/element-types" (_feature-sliced/layers-slices_) from eslint plugin _@feature-sliced/eslint-config_. See example in [patches/@feature-sliced+eslint-config+0.1.0-beta.6.patch](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/blob/main/patches/%40feature-sliced%2Beslint-config%2B0.1.0-beta.6.patch).

### Widgets cross imports (custom sublayers)

> See https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/pull/21 for more information about custom sublayer "base widgets".

I think you agree with me, that user interfaces are very complex nowadays. In FSD our interface is represented by `entities`, `features` and `widgets` layers. But usually we don't have enough layers to composite UI.

For example, we have widget `BaseProductList` which use different entities and features. At the same time we have N widgets like `{Any}ProductList` (for example `PopularProductList` or `CartProductList`) which use `BaseProductList`:

![](../example-cross-imports@dark.jpg#gh-dark-mode-only) ![](../example-cross-imports@light.jpg#gh-light-mode-only)

Of course, we can make dumb `ProductList`, place it on `entities/product` slice and pass all data as props. Sometimes render-props is a very powerful pattern and it works. But in this example it's a wrong way (a lot of duplicate logic and prop-hell components because every of N widgets will duplicate each other's logic):

```tsx
// üìÅ widgets/PopularProductList/ui/PopularProductList.tsx

function PopularProductList() {
  return (
    <ProductList
      // üëé A lot duplicated props in every N widget
      // which use ProductList
      cardItemSlot={/* ... */}
      actionCardItemSlot={/* ... */}
      onAddToWishlist={/* ... */}
      onAddToCart={}
      onRemoveFromCart={}
      // A lot of props ....
      products={products}
    />
  )
}
```

So, there are several options:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Follow the classic FSD version and move widgets to entity (hello prop drilling and hell of duplication üëé);
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Allow cross-imports between widgets (it's a pretty simple workaround, but hello high coupling üëé);
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add a new layer like `page-widgets` or `entity-widgets` (it complicates architecture and module communication in general üëé);
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Add a new sublayer for base widgets (similar with previous options, but we don't introduce new global layer ü§î).

Initially, this project used the second approach 2Ô∏è‚É£ (we use this approach on the working project as well), when cross-imports between widgets were allowed. But this options violates the low coupling principle, and this can become a problem in large projects.

So this project is introducing a fourth option: 4Ô∏è‚É£ a new sublayer for base widgets that can be imported by other widgets. If a widget's name starts with `widget/Base*`, then it is a base widget and can be imported by other widgets.

You can see example in [widgets/PopularProductList/\*](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/blob/main/src/widgets/ProductPopularList/ui/ProductPopularList.tsx#L10)

Additionally, there is a fixing rule "boundaries/element-types" (_feature-sliced/layers-slices_) from eslint plugin _@feature-sliced/eslint-config_. See example in [patches/@feature-sliced+eslint-config+0.1.0-beta.6.patch](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/blob/main/patches/%40feature-sliced%2Beslint-config%2B0.1.0-beta.6.patch).
