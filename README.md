An open source frontend application built using the **React** ⚛️ and **Feature-Sliced Design** 🍰.

> This app is a work in progress. See the roadmap below.

- React, Redux Toolkit, React Hook Form, Zod
- Vite, TypeScript, PostCSS
- Architecture based on Feature-Sliced Design

## Live demo

- [Storybook stand](https://nukeapp-story.netlify.app/)

## About project

Right now, I'm using this project as an experiment polygon to try modern technologies and see how a can see frontend application in {{CURRENT_YEAR}}. This project structure combines two methodology: Clean Architecture and Feature-Sliced Design.

## Features

- Fully Typed (API adapters, catched error with type guards, form and env variables validators by `zod`)
- Developing by Feature Sliced Design (Layers isolation and composition, Public API, DDD)
- Fully API emulation with `mswjs` (all enpoints with JWT authorization)
- Storybook stories
- Best practice comments in code ✅

## Running locally

> Note: You can use `npm` or `yarn` as package manager instead of `pnpm`, just remove [`npx only-allow pnpm`](https://github.com/noveogroup-amorgunov/nukeapp/blob/main/package.json#L12) from `package.json`.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Start Vite development server

```bash
pnpm start
```

or start Storybook stand

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

4. If you use VSCode, you can set custom settings for auto fix on save (provided by [antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config?tab=readme-ov-file#vs-code-support-auto-fix-on-save))

## Troubleshoots

- Package `@mswjs/data` can not sync data in `localStorage`. With the current implementation (without synchronization), after updating the page, the state (cart, wishlist) is lost. I made a pull request with this feature (https://github.com/mswjs/data/pull/277), but it has not merged yet. So I use forked version (you can see path in _package.json_).

- Package `@feature-sliced/eslint-config` don't work on eslint 9 with flat config. That's why it's turned off now.
